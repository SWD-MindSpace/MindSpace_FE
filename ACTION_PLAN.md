# Appointment History Page Implementation Plan

## Overview

Create a page to retrieve and display appointment history using reusable components.

## Tasks

### TASK 1: Create Appointment Types and API Service ✓

- [x] Define AppointmentResponse interface based on the API response
- [x] Create API service function to fetch appointment history from the specified endpoint
- [x] Ensure authentication token is properly used for API calls

### TASK 2: Create Appointment List Component ✓

- [x] Create client component for handling data fetching and state
- [x] Implement date range filters for appointment history
- [x] Add pagination functionality based on the API response
- [x] Use Table component for displaying appointment data

### TASK 3: Update the Appointments Page ✓

- [x] Update the page.tsx file to use the new AppointmentList component
- [x] Add metadata for the page

## Implementation Details

### Appointment Response Interface

```typescript
export interface AppointmentResponse {
  date: string;
  startTime: string;
  endTime: string;
  studentName: string;
  isUpcoming: boolean;
  meetUrl: string | null;
}

export interface AppointmentListResponse {
  pageIndex: number;
  pageSize: number;
  count: number;
  data: AppointmentResponse[];
}
```

### API Service

```typescript
export const getPsychologistAppointments = async (
  searchParams: AppointmentQueryParams
) => {
  // Implementation that calls the endpoint:
  // https://localhost:7096/api/v1/appointments/psychologist
  // with authentication header and query parameters
};
```

### Columns for Appointment History

- Student Name
- Date
- Time
- Status
- Actions (view details, join meeting)

## Work Summary

All tasks have been completed successfully. The appointment history page has been implemented with the following features:

1. **Types and API Integration**:

   - Created AppointmentResponse interface matching the API response
   - Implemented getPsychologistAppointments function that properly uses authentication
   - Set up proper query parameter handling for the API endpoint

2. **Filtering and Pagination**:

   - Added date range filters (startDate and endDate)
   - Implemented default date range (past month to today) if no filters are selected
   - Set up pagination based on the API response count and pageSize

3. **UI Components**:

   - Used Table component to display appointment data in a structured format
   - Implemented status chips to show appointment status (Upcoming/Completed)
   - Added action buttons for viewing details and joining meetings
   - Used Pagination component for page navigation

4. **State Management**:
   - Used URL parameters for search and filter state
   - Implemented proper error handling and loading states
   - Set up debounced input handling for better performance

This implementation follows the project's conventions and reuses existing UI components. The code is type-safe and properly handles authentication, loading states, and error scenarios.
